## Exercise 11: Using Network Watcher to Test and Validate Connectivity

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will collect the flow log and perform connectivity from your simulated on-premises environment to Azure. This will be accomplished by using the Network Watcher Service in the Azure Platform.

### Task 1: Configuring the Storage Account for the NSG Flow Logs

1. On the Azure portal select **+ Create a resource**. From the Azure Marketplace menu select **storage** then select **Storage Account**

2. On the **Create Storage account** blade. Enter the following information, and select **Review + Create** then select the **Create** button:

    -  Subscription: **Your Subscription**

    -  Resource Group: **MonitoringRG** (Use the existing resource group created earlier.)

    -  Storage Account Name: **This must be Unique and alphanumeric, lowercase and no special characters.**
    
       >Note: Use **Deployment ID** to make the name unique, get **Deployment ID** from the Environment Details Tab, for example: **mysaDeploymentID**

    -  Location: **South Central US**

    -  Performance: **Standard**

    -  Account Kind: **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**

    -  Replication: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

    -  Access Tier Default: **Hot**

   >**Note:** Ensure the storage account is created before continuing.

3. Repeat step 2, but select **East US** for the region and give it unique name like **saxxxxx**.

   >Note: Use **Deployment ID** to make the name unique, get **Deployment ID** from the Environment Details Tab, for example: **saDeploymentID**

    ![Storage blade: information entry.](images/ecn24.png "Add storage account")

3. On the Azure portal select **All services** at the left navigation. From the Categories menu select **Networking** then select **Network Watcher**.

4. From the **Network Watcher** blade under the **Logs** menu select **NSG flow logs**. You will see both the **OnPremVM-nsg** and **WGAppNSG1** Network Security Groups.

5. Select the **WGAppNSG1** network security group to open the flow log settings. Select **On** and then select **Version 2** for the Flow logs version.

6. Select **Storage Account-Configure**. From the drop down select the available storage account created earlier, then the **OK** button.

7. Select **On** to enable the traffic analytics status and set the interval to 10 minutes. Select the **Log Analytics Workspace** created earlier. Select **Save** at the top to confirm the settings.

8. Repeat Steps 4 - 7 to enable the **OnPremVM-nsg** Network Security Group as well. When completed your configuration should show as the following image.

9. Navigate back to the **OnPremVM**. Connect to it by downloading and opening the RDP file. Then open another RDP connection to the **WGMGMT1** virtual machine within the connection to **OnPremVM**. In the RDP connection to **WGMGMT1**, navigate to the load balancer's private ip and generate some traffic by refreshing the browser. Allow ten minutes to pass for traffic analytics to generate.

### Task 2: Configuring Diagnostic Logs

1. On the Azure portal, select **All services** at the left navigation. From the Categories menu select **Networking**, then **Network Watcher**,

2. Select **Diagnostic Logs** from the **Logs Menu** within the blade.

3. Select **onpremvmXXX** then select **+Add diagnostic setting**.

4. Enter **OnPremDiag** as the name then select the checkbox for **Archive to a storage account**. Select **Storage account** and from the drop down select the available storage account you created earlier. Select **OK**.

### Task 3: Reviewing Network Traffic

1. On the Azure portal select **All services** at the left navigation. From the Categories menu select **Networking** then select **Network Watcher**.

2. Select **Traffic Analytics** from the **Logs** menu in the blade. At this time the diagnostic logs from the network resources have been ingested. Select **View map**.

>**Note:** You can select the **See More** link to query the connections detail for more information.

### Task 4: Network Connection Troubleshooting

1. On the Azure portal select **All services** at the left navigation. From the Categories menu select **Networking** then select **Network Watcher**.

2. Select **Connection Troubleshoot** from the **Network Diagnostic tools** menu.

3. To troubleshoot a connection or to validate the route enter the following information and select **Check**:
   
    -  Subscription: **Your Subscription**

    -  Resource Group: **OnPremVMRG**

    -  Source Type: **Virtual Machine**

    -  Virtual Machine: **OnPremVM**

    -  Destination: **Select a virtual machine**
 
    -  Resource Group: **WGVNetRG2**
 
    -  Virtual Machine: **WGWEB1**

    -  Probe Settings: **TCP**
    
    -  Destination Port: **80**

     ![Network Watcher Connection Troubleshoot Blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image198.png "Connection Troubleshoot")

4. Once the check is complete the connection troubleshoot feature will display a grid view on the name, IP Address Status and Next hop as seen in the following screenshot.
