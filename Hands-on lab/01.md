### Task 1: Create a Virtual Network

1.  From your **LABVM**, connect to the Azure portal, select **+ Create a resource**, and in the list of Marketplace categories, select **Networking** followed by selecting **Virtual Network**.

2.  On the **Create virtual network** blade under Basics, enter the following information:

    -  Name: **WGVNet1**

    ![Adress Space.](images/ecn02.png "Create virtual network")
    
    And Click on **+ Add Subnet** to add subnets to the virtual network
    
    Then provide the values for:
    
    -  Subnet name: **GatewaySubnet** (This name is fixed and cannot be changed.)
    
    -  Subnet address range: **10.7.0.0/29**

4.  Leave the other options as default for now.

5.  Upon completion, it should look like the following screenshot. Validate the information is correct, and select **Create**.

6.  Monitor the deployment status by selecting **Notifications Bell** at the top of the portal. In a minute or so, you should see a confirmation of the successful deployment. Select **Go to Resource**.

### Task 2: Configure subnets
