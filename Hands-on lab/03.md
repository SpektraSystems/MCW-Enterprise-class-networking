## Exercise 3: Create route tables with required routes

Duration: 15 minutes

Route Tables are containers for User Defined Routes (UDRs). The route table is created and associated with a subnet. UDRs allow you to direct traffic in ways other than normal system routes would. In this case, UDRs will direct outbound traffic via the Azure firewall.

### Task 1: Create route tables

1.  On the main portal menu, select **+ Create a Resource**. Type **route** into the search box, and select **Route table** then select **Create**.

2.  On the **Create a Route table** blade enter the following information:

    -  Name: **MgmtRT**

    -  Subscription: **Select your subscription**.

    -  Resource group: Select **WGVNetRG1** from the drop down.

    -  Location: **(US) South Central US**

    -  Virtual network gateway route propagation: **Enabled**

3.  When the dialog looks like the following screenshot, select **Create**.

4.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create the **AppRT** route table:

    -  Name: **AppRT**

    -  Subscription: **Select your subscription**.

    -  Resource group: Select **WGVNetRG2** from the drop down.

    -  Location: **(US) South Central US**

    -  Virtual network gateway route propagation: **Enabled**

5.  Once route tables are created, your **Route tables** blade should look like the following screenshot:

### Task 2: Add routes to each route table

1.  Select the **AppRT** route table, and select **Routes** under **Settings** on the left.

    ![On the Route table blade, under Settings, Routes is selected. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image39.png "Route table blade ")

2.  On the **Routes** blade, select **+ Add**. Enter the following information, and click **OK**

    -  Route name: **AppToInternet**

    -  Address prefix: **0.0.0.0/0**

    -  Next hop type: **Virtual appliance**

    -  Next hop address: **10.7.1.4** and click **OK**

    ![The AppToInternet route is being added.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image40.png "Add route configuration")

3.  Repeat this procedure to add the **AppToMgmt** route using the following information:

    -  Route name: **AppToMgmt**

    -  Address prefix: **10.7.0.8/29**

    -  Next hop type: **Virtual appliance**

    -  Next hop address: **10.7.1.4** and click **OK**

    ![The AppToMgmt route is being added.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image41.png "Edit route")

4.  Upon completion, your routes in the **AppRT** route table should look like the following screenshot:

    ![AppRT route table is seen here if successful.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image43.png "Route table ")

5.  In the Azure Portal, go to All Services and type Route in the search box and select **Route tables**.

6.  Select **MgmtRT**, and select **Routes** under **Settings** on the left.

    ![Under Name, MgmtRT is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image50.png "MgmtRT")

7.  On the **Routes** blade, select +**Add**. Enter the following information, and click **OK**

    -  Route name: **MgmtToOnPremises**

    -  Address prefix: **192.168.0.0/16**

    -  Next hop type: **Virtual network gateway**

    -  Next hop address: **Leave blank** and click **OK**

    ![Continuation of steps to adding another route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image51.png "Add route")

8.  Add the **MgmtToApp** route using the following information:

    -  Route name: **MgmtToApp**

    -  Address prefix: **10.7.2.0/25**

    -  Next hop type: **Virtual appliance**

    -  Next hop address: **10.7.1.4** (This is the private IP of Azure Firewall.) and click **OK**

    ![Continuation of steps to adding another route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image164.png "Add route")

9.  Upon completion, your routes in the **MgmtRT** route table should look like the following screenshot:

    ![Continuation of steps to adding another route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image165.png "Route table")

    >**Note:** The route tables and routes you have just created are not associated with any subnets yet, so they are not impacting any traffic flow yet. This will be accomplished later in the lab.
